# UdacityMLNanodegree
This Repository contains the projects which are part of Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.

Machine Learning is behind these innovations like how Netflix recommends the movies you’ll like or Spotify renders Discover Weekly.It represents a key evolution in the fields of computer science, data analysis, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. Since 2014, there has been a 200% Y-o-Y increase in “Data Scientist” job searches and a 50% Y-o-Y increase in job listings. 

This Nanodegree program asks to apply predictive models to massive data sets in fields like finance, healthcare, education, and more.As a part of this program multiple areas of applied machine learning was thoroughly tought using lectures and hands on projects implemented using in each module as given below :
